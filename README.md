Certainly! Here's a template for your `README.md` file on GitHub, tailored to your project of building an email parsing and AI-driven response tool using TypeScript, BullMQ for task scheduling, and integration with Google and Outlook APIs.

# Email Assistant Tool

This project is a TypeScript-based tool that integrates with Gmail and Outlook APIs to parse incoming emails, apply AI-driven context analysis, and generate automated responses based on the email content.

## Features

- **OAuth Integration**: Authenticate with Gmail and Outlook using OAuth for secure API access.
- **Email Parsing**: Read incoming emails from configured Gmail and Outlook accounts.
- **AI Context Analysis**: Utilize OpenAI for understanding email context and assigning labels (Interested, Not Interested, More Information).
- **Automated Responses**: Generate and send appropriate replies based on the email content.
- **Task Scheduling**: Use BullMQ for task scheduling to manage background jobs effectively.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed.
- Redis running locally or accessible via a cloud service.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd email-assistant-tool
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```plaintext
   # Redis Configuration
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   REDIS_HOST=localhost
   REDIS_PASSWORD=

   # Google OAuth Credentials
   GOOGLE_CLIENTID=your_google_client_id
   GOOGLE_CLIENTSECRET=your_google_client_secret
   GOOGLE_REDIRECTURI=http://localhost:3000/google/auth/callback

   # Outlook OAuth Credentials
   OUTLOOK_CLIENTID=your_outlook_client_id
   OUTLOOK_CLIENTSECRET=your_outlook_client_secret
   OUTLOOK_REDIRECTURI=http://localhost:3000/outlook/auth/callback

   # OpenAI API Key
   OPENAI_APIKEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

   Replace `your_google_client_id`, `your_google_client_secret`, `your_outlook_client_id`, `your_outlook_client_secret`, and `your_openai_api_key` with your actual credentials obtained from respective services.

### Usage

1. **Start the Application**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the application and initialize the necessary services.

2. **OAuth Authentication**:

   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/google/auth` to authenticate with Google.
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/outlook/auth` to authenticate with Outlook.

3. **Demo and Testing**:

   - Send test emails to your configured Gmail and Outlook accounts.
   - Check the console logs and email responses generated by the tool based on the email content.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure Redis is running and accessible before starting the application.
- Customize the AI response logic (`readLabelAndReply` function) in `openAI.utils.ts` based on specific business rules and email context requirements.
